    This python module is a CAD library of parametric pipes.

    The pipes created by this package are based off the following standards:

    * ASTM A312 is a standard specification issued by the American Society for
    Testing and Materials (ASTM) that covers seamless,  welded, and heavily
    cold-worked austenitic stainless steel pipe intended for high-temperature 
    and general corrosive service. The standard specifies various dimensions,  
    mechanical properties,  testing requirements,  and acceptable manufacturing 
    practices for stainless steel pipes.
    * ASME B36 is a standard issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
    (ASME) that provides guidelines for the dimensions, tolerances, and related 
    requirements of steel pipes and fittings. It covers both seamless and welded 
    pipes made from various materials, including carbon steel, stainless steel, 
    and alloy steel. The standard specifies the nominal pipe sizes (NPS), outside 
    diameters (OD), wall thicknesses, and length dimensions. ASME B36 aims to ensure 
    consistency and compatibility in the design, manufacturing, and installation of 
    steel pipes, facilitating efficient piping system construction and operation in 
    various industries.
    * ASTM B88 is a standard specification issued by ASTM International for seamless 
    copper water tube used in plumbing applications. The standard defines the requirements 
    for copper water tube in terms of its dimensions, chemical composition, mechanical 
    properties, and permissible variations. It covers various sizes and types of copper 
    water tube, including both hard-drawn and annealed tempers. ASTM B88 ensures the 
    quality and reliability of copper water tube by providing specifications for its 
    manufacturing and performance. It serves as a reference for manufacturers, engineers, 
    and contractors involved in plumbing systems, ensuring compatibility, durability, 
    and safe water transportation.
    * ASTM F628 is a standard specification issued by ASTM International that pertains 
    to the installation and performance requirements of plastic pipes in non-pressure 
    applications. It specifically focuses on the installation of plastic pipes, such 
    as PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and CPVC (Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride), for drainage, 
    waste, and vent systems. The standard covers various aspects, including pipe sizes, 
    materials, dimensions, joint methods, and testing procedures. ASTM F628 ensures the 
    proper installation and performance of plastic pipes in non-pressure plumbing 
    applications, promoting safe and efficient drainage and waste disposal systems in 
    residential and commercial buildings.
    * ASTM D1785 is a standard specification issued by ASTM International for rigid 
    polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes used in pressure applications, primarily in potable
    water systems. The standard outlines the requirements for PVC pipes in terms of 
    their dimensions, material properties, and quality control procedures. It covers 
    various aspects, including pipe sizes, wall thicknesses, chemical composition, 
    hydrostatic pressure testing, and marking. ASTM D1785 ensures the durability, 
    strength, and safety of PVC pipes by establishing guidelines for their manufacturing, 
    performance, and testing. The standard serves as a reference for manufacturers, 
    engineers, and regulatory bodies to ensure the reliable and efficient use of PVC 
    pipes in pressure applications.
