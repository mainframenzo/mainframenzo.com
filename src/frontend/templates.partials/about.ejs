<p>My <emphasis>internet alias</emphasis> is Enzo, from Mainframe <parenthetical>(from <a href='https://reboot.fandom.com/wiki/Enzo_Matrix' target='_blank'>Reboot</a>)</parenthetical>. He made things in <emphasis>his universe</emphasis>, and I make things in <emphasis>mine</emphasis>. I use an alias to remain anonymous to the degree <a href='https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/_why-the-lucky-stiff-printer-spool-2013' target='_blank'>one can remain anonymous</a> <parenthetical>(which is to say not much, but just enough)</parenthetical>, so that I may write on my own terms regardless of current contractual obligations.</p>

<p>This blog focuses on documenting the designing, building, and <emphasis>sometimes</emphasis> testing of the things I have made, but also contains musings that were borne of that documenting. I was never much of a writer <parenthetical>(I am still searching for my writing voice)</parenthetical>, nor am I someone interested in living in the past, but I thought, "perhaps it is time to revisit the archives" before I forgot the <emphasis>Behind-the-Music</emphasis> of it all.</p>

<p>Before social media, I shared things with other people just like this - by hosting my own website. I switched to sharing through social media because <emphasis>everyone</emphasis> was there and readers were easier to come by, not because the features the platforms provided were tailored to what I needed. What I mainly needed was the ability to share varied length writing without a cap on embedded media. The more writing-focused platforms <parenthetical>(which I still considerered social media)</parenthetical> had this, but they all seemed to go "walled" in the end, which of course meant readers were less easy to come by. What I additionally wanted was control over the form factor; custom styling features like "old" Myspace had provided would have sufficed. The form I imagined this blog to take did not fit within the limitations of the platforms I was eyeing, and by 2016, I had started to reverse course.</p>

<p>One major gripe I have of our society is being forced to consume ads. Ads on the radio, television, websites, before movies, software on my computer, on billboards above the roads, painted on the side of buildings, glued to cars, yelled at me, mailed to me, e-mailed to me, texted to me. The platforms had become too ad-centric, their distractions overwhelming. But I had stayed because I felt like I was missing something.</p>

<p>My tipping point for <emphasis>Social Media Overload</emphasis> was when vitriol overtook my Facebook feed in the form of "status updates". It was not just bot bullshit; it was created by people I knew <emphasis>in real life</emphasis>. I tended to use ignonimy as a tool for teaching, but packaged in humour - a very Midwestern approach <parenthetical>(it turns out ignominy is not included in the <a href='https://www.twinkl.com/teaching-wiki/5-pedagogical-approaches' target='_blank'>5 Pillars of Pedagogy</a>...I guess the creators of those did not grow up in the Midwest)</parenthetical>. By then I had learned that this sixth pillar was not effective when two people are typing at one another on the internet. The shame does not stick. So I left.</p>

<p>Instead of hosting my own website again, I decided to remove myself from the internet entirely, which included all social media, especially Facebook. I felt done. I was told this was "weird" at one point by folks in my same generational cohort, but it never felt that way. I was mostly successful, save for a "googleable" record of a season with a high penalty minute count in my men's hockey league. This record still remained despite my having asked for it to be removed. My kind request for removal was met with the response, "We'll try, we've never been asked before".</p>

<p>So here we are; this website essentially a <emphasis>catch-all</emphasis> for web platforms <emphasis>abandoned</emphasis>. I still love the web for what it has given me, and also still for what the old dog <emphasis>could</emphasis> be.</p>

<p>I write this blog much more for my purposes then for yours, dear reader. This is fun for me :) I like to create things for lots of reasons, but primarily I enjoy the process of learning followed by application of that knowledge, flexing those critical thinking skills. Creating also gives me an outlet for artistic expression - an avenue for communication <emphasis>non verbo</emphasis>. How do you build gratitude and appreciation, dear reader? I build appreciation for the world <emphasis>the more I come to understand it</emphasis>, and the more I come to understand it, the more I understand I can never understand all of it <parenthetical>(ad infinitum)</parenthetical>. And bringing objects into this world has helped me build appreciation for the ones already here. <emphasis>It is so much easier to destroy than it is to create.</emphasis></p>

<p>The projects I am documenting here can take a long time to come together, even with substantial design investment up front. When to move the sticky note from the "work in progress" to the "complete" column is not always clear for me; sometimes <emphasis>time</emphasis> is the only indicator. My process is <emphasis>amelorative</emphasis>. When I become stuck - something that happens often - I tend to "circle", which is just a nicer way to say I move to another project while my subconscious chews on the problem. I prefer this to <gesture>[licks thumb and sticks it in the air]</gesture> winging it, which with physical objects leads to less polish <parenthetical>(but a fine approach to prototypes, which some of these projects are)</parenthetical>. What I mean by this is, dear reader, do not expect updates frequently.</p> 
  
<p>There are lots of websites like this on the internet, but this one is mine :) <a href='https://stownpodcast.org/chapter/7' target='_blank'>Much love and respect</a> - Mainframe Enzo</p>
