<p>My internet alias is Enzo, derived from Mainframe (from Reboot). He created things in his universe, and I create things in mine. I employ an alias to maintain anonymity to the extent one can remain anonymous (which is admittedly limited, but sufficient), allowing me to write freely regardless of existing contractual obligations.</p>

<p>This blog centers on chronicling the design, construction, and occasional testing of my creations, while also incorporating reflections that emerged from that documentation. I've never considered myself a proficient writer (I'm still developing my literary voice), nor am I inclined to dwell in the past, but I thought, "perhaps it's time to revisit the archives" before the behind-the-scenes stories fade from memory.</p>

<p>Before social media's advent, I shared content through traditional means - maintaining my own website. I migrated to social media platforms because of their widespread audience and accessibility, not because their features were optimized for my needs. My primary requirement was the ability to share varied-length writing with unlimited media embeddings. While writing-focused platforms (which I still categorize as social media) offered this, they eventually became "walled gardens," diminishing their reach. Additionally, I desired control over presentation; customization features like those of "classic" MySpace would have been adequate. The format I envisioned for this blog exceeded the constraints of available platforms, and by 2016, I began reverting to my original approach.</p>

<p>What I find most objectionable about our society is the forced consumption of advertisements. They're omnipresent: on radio, television, websites, computer software, roadside billboards, building facades, vehicle wraps, verbal solicitations, postal mail, email, and text messages. The platforms had become overwhelmingly ad-centric, their distractions intolerable. Yet I lingered, fearing I might miss something significant.</p>

<p>My breaking point with Social Media Overload came when vitriol dominated my Facebook feed through "status updates." This wasn't merely algorithmic content; it originated from real-life acquaintances. I traditionally employed ignominy as a teaching tool, wrapped in humor - a characteristically Midwestern approach (though ignominy isn't included in the 5 Pillars of Pedagogy... perhaps its creators weren't Midwesterners ;)). I'd learned this sixth pillar proved ineffective in online discourse. The intended impact dissipated. So I departed.</p>

<p>Rather than reviving my personal website, I opted to minimize my internet presence to the extent possible, eliminating all social media, particularly Facebook. I felt complete. Though some peers from my generation deemed this "peculiar," it felt natural to me. I largely succeeded, save for a persistent record of a high-penalty season in my men's hockey league, which remains despite my removal request. My polite petition was met with an unprecedented response: "We'll try, we've never received such a request."</p>

<p>So here we stand; this website essentially serves as a repository for abandoned web platforms. I maintain my appreciation for the web's contributions and its untapped potential.</p>

<p>I compose this blog primarily for my own purposes rather than yours, dear reader. This endeavor brings me joy :) I pursue creation for various reasons, but predominantly for the pleasure of learning followed by the application of that knowledge through critical thinking. Creating also provides an outlet for artistic expression - a form of nonverbal communication. How does one cultivate gratitude and appreciation, dear reader? My appreciation for the world deepens as my understanding grows, and the more I comprehend, the more I recognize the limitless nature of what remains to be understood (ad infinitum). Bringing new objects into existence has enhanced my appreciation for those already present.</p>

<p>These projects often require extensive time to materialize, even with substantial initial design investment. The transition point for moving a sticky note from "work in progress" to "complete" isn't always evident; time becomes the distinguishing factor. My process is ameliorative; when encountering obstacles, which occurs frequently, I tend to "circle" - a euphemism for shifting to another project while my subconscious processes the challenge. I prefer this methodical approach to improvising [licks thumb and holds it to the wind], which typically results in less refined physical objects (though it's perfectly suitable for prototypes, which some of these projects are). In other words, dear reader, expect updates to be intermittent.</p>

<p>There are numerous websites of this nature on the internet, but this one is distinctly mine :) Much love and respect - Mainframe Enzo</p>
