    The v2 dashboard back from the Powder Coaters; they managed to match the color! 
    I got excited and accidentally installed the gauges upside down <parenthetical>(and on the wrong side)</parenthetical>. <emphasis>Whoopsies</emphasis>. 
    I set v2 aside after this and waited to find time for installing it.

    All the gauges on Frances stopped working one day, then a few days later the alternator went out as well. Cöincidence? The time had come to install v2.

    During v1's installation many years ago, I had encountered a problem with the radio knob holes and face being too small. I remembered to make them bigger this time around. 
    Unfortunately, I remembered half-wrong. The radio knob holes weren't <emphasis>too small</emphasis>, they were just in the wrong place! <emphasis>Whoopsies</emphasis>.

- description: >-
    I, once again, drilled holes to solve the problem. But the problem was compounded by the fact that larger, unused, radio knob holes were no longer hidden by its face plate. 
    But at least I finally had an excuse to replace the plastic radio face plate with metal :)

    The aluminium backing I installed for v1 to screw into had to be removed because it interfered with the new speedometer, which was larger than the original.

    I needed a way to mount v2 to the original steel dashboard using "dashboard-to-dashboard mounts"...which I needed to make. 
    Warning, shoddy solution ahead: I grabbed some plastic moulding from Big Box Hardware Store and cut it into pieces. Voilà - dashboard-to-dashboard mounts.

    I would have called this gap a problem, but I knew this would happen, and figured it would be fine. It was.
    From anywhere except underneath you can't tell there's a gap where the "new Tech mount" sits. 
    I would have went with thinner aluminium, but I wanted it to be stiff enough to handle getting hit by passengers, etc.

- description: >-
    This gap on top <emphasis>is</emphasis> a problem. It is the result of not being able to get one of the dashboard-to-dashboard mounts properly seated.
    Fixing the problem requires taking the dashboard out and cutting some steel tabs <parenthetical>(for mounting the original gauge cluster)</parenthetical> which are in the way.
    I do not want to take the dashboard out, again. Since you can't see it from any angle I care about, 
      this "problem" is "backlogged" until the next time the dashboard needs to come out. FIXME

    Crank up the music! Oh wait, no speakers yet. The speaker assembly is a simple bracket, 
    two pieces of stainless steel mesh layed on top of each other, two speakers, and some hardware. The speakers mount to the bracket, 
      the bracket mounts to the dashboard, and the mesh layers sit between the speakers and the bracket.

- description: >-
    Drilling holes in the mesh took me a couple tries - I ripped up a piece with the drill
      because I had not left enough extra material on the edges, and the drill just gobbled it up.
    I also messed up the mounting holes for the speakers <parenthetical>(measure twice, blah blah)</parenthetical>, so I had to drill new ones. <emphasis>Whoopsies</emphasis>.
