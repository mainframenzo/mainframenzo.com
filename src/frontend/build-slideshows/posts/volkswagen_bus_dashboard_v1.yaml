    Did the original dashboard not have a properly sized hole for modern radios?
    The jagged cuts are surely not factory?

    The original gauge cluster. It is hard to see, but a temperature gauge was added during the Subaru engine conversion.

    I opted not to make a custom radio face plate for v1 because I wanted to be sure the radio would last before I committed to it!
